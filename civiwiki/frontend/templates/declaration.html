        <h4>The CiviWiki Declaration of Self Governance</h4>
        <p>In the course of human events the Laws of Nature and Nature’s God entitle each generation an opportunity to remake the world according to their common values. Recognizing a diversity of values, experience, and a decent respect of the opinion of humankind requires that any attempt to alter the nature of representation should candidly declare the values upheld and the cause which impel action.</p>
        <p>We hold these truths to be self evident, that all humans are created equal, that they are all endowed by their creator with certain inalienable Rights; that among these are Life, Liberty, Education and those necessities to pursue happiness. To secure these Rights, societies establish governments, deriving their just powers by representing the will of the people. That whenever any form of Government fails to adequately represent the will of the people, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new systems likely to better reflect their common voice. Prudence dictates that long established governments should not be altered for light or transient causes. But, in a world where technology, and connectivity, is advancing at rates never before seen in history, while government fails to adapt this technology to enhance the people’s participation in self-governance, it is the duty of the people to develop their own system for meaningful participation. This is the directive of CiviWiki.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we the people of the internet age, in order to form a more perfect union, to establish justice, to insure government accountability, to provide for a common voice, to promote the general welfare, and to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish CiviWiki.org.</p>
